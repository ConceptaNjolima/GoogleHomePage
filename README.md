# GoogleHomePage
This a project where the Introduction to Web development class will practice github branching, HTML, and CSS skills by developing a Google HomePage

This week we will build this [Google.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759if_/https://www.google.com/)homepage

We will all be working in the same repository. Clone this repository
In the repository create a branch named [Your first name] [Your Last Name]
Then check out your branch, and create a folder name  [Your first name] [Your Last Name] 
Inside this folder, add index.html and styles.css files.

Add this point, commit all changes and try pushing your files to Github
In the dropdown next to master on Github, are you able to view your branch?
When you click on your branch name, are you able to see the two files?

If yes, Great. You will use your knowledge of Html and CSS to build your version of the google search page shown [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759if_/https://www.google.com/)
TheGoogle logo can be found [here](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)

If no, Great. Ensure you follow the steps above. And if everything looks okay, then reach out to the WhatsApp group.

**Remember: As you work through your code, continuously commit and push your changes so that you keep a copy of your work online at all times.**
